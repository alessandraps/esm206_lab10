## beepr beeps 
Use the function `beep()` in the beepr package to make an audio alert when your code is done running 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# eval = FALSE, so that it doesn't run every time
# Adding a number to beep() will have different sounds.
# For each value in this vector called "i"

for (i in rev(seq(1:9999))) {
  
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall"))
  
}

# beep(5)
```

## praise and cowsay 

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun

```{r}
praise("${creating}, Batman - this code is...${ADJECTIVE}!!!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you
